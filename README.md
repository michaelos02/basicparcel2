## Practicing with parcel

This is a working example of using **Parcel 1.0, SASS, and parcel-plugin-inliner**

There are 2 html files that are being built.  The Code.gs file uses a paramenter flag to determine which page to display.

Some notes:
- clasp needs to be installed and logged in everytime I open gitpod
- Need to build, run utils.js, clasp push then clasp open 
  - these are easily added as scripts in package.json
- Set the folder structrue!!!
- GAS
  - this is where the actual files going to the GAS script editor will be. DON'T mess with them!
- SERVER
  - this is the file that will have all the "js" files that will become "gs" files. THESE are the ones you code with
- SRC
  - this is where the "HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS" files for the html pages are worked on
- DIST
  - is created by parcel
